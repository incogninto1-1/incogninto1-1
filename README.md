Hello everyone. I am incogninto1-1. I am a 16 y/o making code because I am bored
One of my projects is a Linux distro Codename: LinX86. A Linux distro made to be
universal. I am also in a group made by me called 8X Computing Squad 
(before known as 8X Computing Inc. Changed because I never registered it as a company)
that I started back in 2019 trying to make a modified BIOS, then In 2020 I made a
project for an Open Source game console (didn't make prototypes yet) in 2021
a game mae in Unity, and in 2022 I have a WIP linux distro (I know I already said that)
with a WIP package manager. I use GCC to compile and use mostly Arch, Fedora and Debian
on my main computers. Enjoy my gits and if you want to contact me just use 
incogninto123(at)gmail(dot)com .
